    <p>How to Make Samosa</p><br><br>
  </div>
  <div class="sa">
    <p class="p">To prepare samosa:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and oil or <br>ghee. Rub the oil into the flour mixture using your fingertips until it <br>resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead until<br> you have a smooth and firm dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</p></li>

      <li><p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let<br> them splutter. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Add grated ginger and chopped green chilies (if using) to the pan. Sauté for<br> a minute until fragrant.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Stir in the boiled mashed potatoes and boiled green peas. Mix well.<br>
      Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, red chili powder, and salt to <br>the potato mixture.</p></li>
      <li><p>Mix until all the spices are well combined. Cook for a few minutes until the ,<br>filling is heated through and aromatic.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Remove the pan from heat and let the filling cool down. Once cooled, add <br>chopped fresh coriander leaves and mix well.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Divide the rested dough into equal-sized balls. Roll out each ball into a <br>thin oval or circle, about 6 inches in diameter.Cut each rolled-out dough<br> circle in half to form two semi-circles.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Take one semi-circle and fold it into a cone shape, sealing the edges by <br>brushing them with water.Fill the cone with a spoonful of the prepared potato <br>filling, making sure not to overfill.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Seal the top of the cone by folding over the remaining dough and pressing<br> the edges together to form a triangular shape. Repeat with the remaining dough<br> and filling.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat. Once the oil is<br> hot, carefully slide in the assembled samosas, a few at a time, and fry<br> until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Remove the fried samosas using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels<br> to remove excess oil.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Serve the hot and crispy samosas with tamarind chutney, mint chutney, or any<br> dipping sauce of your choice. Enjoy your homemade samosas as a delicious snack or appetizer!</p></li><br>
