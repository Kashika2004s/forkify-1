    <p class="p">To prepare Paneer Tikka:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><p>In a mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, gram flour, ginger-garlic paste, red chili<br> powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, chaat masala, salt, and lemon juice.<br> Mix well to form a smooth marinade.</p></li>

      <li><p>Add the paneer cubes to the marinade and gently toss until they are well coated.<br> 
        Allow the paneer to marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator. You can<br> marinate it longer for more flavor.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat. If using skewers, soak them in water<br> for about 30 minutes to prevent them from burning.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Thread the marinated paneer cubes onto skewers, alternating with diced bell<br> peppers and onions if desired.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Brush the paneer skewers with cooking oil or melted butter.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Grill the paneer skewers for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally,<br> until the paneer is golden brown and slightly charred around the edges.<br> If using an oven, you can place the skewers on a baking sheet <br>lined with parchment paper and bake at 200°C (400°F) for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked<br> through.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Once cooked, remove the paneer tikka from the grill or oven and garnish with chopped <br>coriander leaves and lemon wedges.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Serve hot with mint chutney, tamarind chutney, or your favorite dipping sauce.<br> Enjoy your delicious paneer tikka as an appetizer or side dish!</p></li><br>
